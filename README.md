# Omnigame developer assignment

**Task**  
Implement a mini game using Canvas/WebGL. Try to create the most *exciting* experience for the user.

**Description**  
We would like you to create a chance based mini game. No player skill should be involved. We have provided some assets for you to use in this assignment. Choose one of the following game types:

1. Each round the user is presented with randomly generated symbols
2. Each round user is presented with 3 items. Each item can be opened in any order to reveal the symbol inside.

The rules of the game are very simple and applies to both options:
* The game should display at least 3 symbols randomly.
* Revealing 3 different symbols results in a loss.
* Revealing 2 identical symbols results in a win.
* Revealing 3 identical symbols results in a big win.

The game should be initialized with a dataset. For example:
`{ symbols: ['symbol,'symbol1','symbol9'], prize: 100 }`

**Delivery**  
The assignment should be delivered as a ZIP or a link.

**Notes**  
1. You are free to edit the provided images
2. You are free to use any Canvas/WebGL rendering library you want
3. You are free to add your own assets, however some of the provided assets must be used also.
